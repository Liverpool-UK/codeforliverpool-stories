# codeforliverpool-stories

## What is it?

It's a simple Text Adventure about #codeforliverpool. It's to prototype a story about the things we make. It's made by [@cheapjack](https://github.com/cheapjack). Data and code and how we use it to make somewhere better is a good story. And good stories can make people understand what data and code could and should do, better. 

You can render any old `html` in a Twine story. It might be fun to insert some implementations of the other tools #codeforliverpool make inside the story later.

It's made using [Twine 2](https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs). You can [use it here](http://twinery.org/) and can find out about <a href="http://twine2.neocities.org/" target="_blank">how to use Twine 2 here</a>.

## QuickStart

Play it [here](http://whitcraft.uk/codeforliverpool.html)

## Contribute

You can `import` the `codeforliverpool_archive.html` file into the Twine 2 App either in browser or on your computer

You might prefer to make it in [Twine 1](https://github.com/tweecode/twine)

Once it gets bigger we could upload it to the [Interactive Fiction Database](http://ifdb.tads.org/) but it's actually **Interacive non-fiction** so we are going to need another database. ;)

### Other Twine Games

There are some other cool games made with Twine. You could tell some interesting stories about Liverpool in similar ways.
